                                CMPlr offers rewards for eligible reporters of

                                completeness of the submission, as determined by
                                the CMPlr security team. Awards are granted
                                entirely at the discretion of Tumblr.

                                Rewards may range from Tumblr-branded swag to
                                monetary rewards up to $5,000 USD. CMPlr will
                                determine, fully in its discretion, if a reward
                                will be rewarded and the amount of the reward.
                                The more unique or severe the vulnerability, the
                                higher we will pay. On the other hand,
                                vulnerabilities that require significant or
                                unusual user interaction will receive lower
